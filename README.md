# About
So I got this advice from the best, (8 times Amazon best selling author, Lewis Lin):

> "The best of the best people improve themselves not even daily, monthly, or weekly. They improve themselves in seconds."

He then brought up the example of how someone who changes just 1% daily is going to be so much more than others who improve quarterly or weekly.


# Visualization
Daily in the illustration I have, started 10x smaller than Weekly, their name is even bigger than themselves. We could see in just the span of 1 year, how Daily easily surpassed Weekly.
